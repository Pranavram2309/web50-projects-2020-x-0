        <h1> Gameplay <span class="badge badge-secondary"></span></h1>

        <p style="font-size:20px">The Legend of Zelda games feature a mixture of puzzles, action, adventure/battle gameplay, and exploration. 
            These elements have remained constant throughout the series, but with refinements and additions featured in each new game.
            Later games in the series also include stealth gameplay, where the player must avoid enemies while proceeding through a level, 
            as well as racing elements. Although the games can be beaten with a minimal amount of exploration and side quests,
            the player is frequently rewarded with helpful items or increased abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas.
            Some items are consistent and appear many times throughout the series (such as bombs and bomb flowers, which can be used 
            both as weapons and to open blocked or hidden doorways; boomerangs, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys for locked doors; 
            magic swords, shields, and bows and arrows), while others are unique to a single game. Though the games contain many role-playing
            elements (Zelda II: The Adventure of Link is the only one to include an experience system), they emphasize straightforward hack and 
            slash-style combat over the strategic, turn-based or active time combat of series like Final Fantasy. The game's role-playing elements,
            however, have led to much debate over whether or not the Zelda games should be classified as action role-playing games, a genre on which 
            the series has had a strong influence.

            Every game in the main Zelda series has consisted of three principal areas: an overworld in which movement is multidirectional, allowing
            the player some degree of freedom of action; areas of interaction with other characters (merely caves or hidden rooms in the first game, 
            but expanding to entire towns and cities in subsequent games) in which the player gains special items or advice; and dungeons, areas of 
            labyrinthine layout, usually underground, comprising a wide range of difficult enemies, bosses, and items. Each dungeon usually has one 
            major item inside, which is usually essential for solving many of the puzzles within that dungeon and often plays a crucial role in defeating 
            that dungeon's boss, as well as progressing through the game. In nearly every Zelda game, navigating a dungeon is aided by locating a map, 
            which reveals its layout, and a magic compass, which reveals the location of significant and smaller items such as keys and equipment. 
            In later games, the dungeon includes a special "big key" that will unlock the door to battle the dungeon's boss enemy and open the item chest.
            
            In most Zelda games, the player's life meter is represented as a line of hearts. The life meter is replenished a number of different ways, 
            including picking up hearts left by defeated enemies or destroyed objects, fairies or springs located in specific locations, or consuming 
            items such as potions or food. Fairies can be kept in bottles and act as extra lives, reviving the player if they run out of hearts. 
            Players are able to extend their life meter by finding heart-shaped crystals called "Heart Containers". Full heart containers are usually 
            received at the end of dungeons and dropped by the dungeon boss. Smaller "Pieces of Heart" are awarded for completing certain side quests 
            or found hidden around the game world in various places, and require a certain number (usually four) to form a full heart container.
